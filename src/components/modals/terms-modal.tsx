            </h3>
            <p>
              OfferBae participates in several affiliate marketing programs,
              including but not limited to Rakuten, CJ Affiliate, Amazon
              Associates, and AWIN. This means we may earn a commission if you
              click on a link and make a purchase through a third-party
              website. This comes at no extra cost to you.

            <p>
              We do our best to ensure that promotions are current and accurate,
              but we cannot guarantee pricing, availability, or product
              descriptions on third-party sites.
